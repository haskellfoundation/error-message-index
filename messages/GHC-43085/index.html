<p>Type class methods that make use of
<a href="https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/9.12.1/docs/users_guide/exts/instances.html#overlapping-instances">overlapping instances</a>
lead may lead to an error because the resolved candidates would lead to indeterministic program behavior.</p>
<p>We can solve this by annotating the instances with the <code>{-# OVERLAPS #-}</code>, <code>{-# OVERLAPPING #-}</code>, <code>{-# OVERLAPPABLE #-}</code> and <code>{-# INCOHERENT #-}</code> pragma.
The former three can only be used if instances are <em>strictly more specific</em> than one another, i.e. the type of an instance can be substituted for the type of another instance.</p>
<p>Note that <code>{-# INCOHERENT #-}</code> still leads to indeterministic behavior and thus should be used with caution.</p>

    • Overlapping instances for Formatter (Maybe Int)
        arising from a use of ‘format’
      Matching instances:
        instance Formatter (Maybe Int)
          -- Defined at before/Overlapping.hs:13:10
        instance Formatter a =&gt; Formatter (Maybe a)
          -- Defined at before/Overlapping.hs:9:10
    • In the second argument of ‘($)’, namely
        ‘format (Nothing :: Maybe Int)’
      In the expression: putStrLn $ format (Nothing :: Maybe Int)
      In an equation for ‘main’:
          main = putStrLn $ format (Nothing :: Maybe Int)
   |
18 | main = putStrLn $ format (Nothing :: Maybe Int)

    <p>Here, the two instances <code>Formatter (Maybe a)</code> and <code>Formatter (Maybe Int)</code> are overlapping.
Since the latter is more specific, we can solve this by annotating the instances with the <code>{-# OVERLAPPABLE #-}</code> and <code>{-# OVERLAPS #-}</code>.</p>
